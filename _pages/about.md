Born in Shiraz, Iran, I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA, focusing on artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning. My dissertation explores the development of hybrid evolutionary convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with attention mechanisms, demonstrating my commitment to advancing the field of AI. My academic path started with a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Electrical-Telecommunication Engineering from Shiraz University, Iran, which laid the groundwork for my further studies and research in technology and engineering.

I have a diverse professional background that spans academia and industry. Currently, I work as a Research and Development Team Member at the University of Georgia's Small Satellite Research Laboratory, where I apply my expertise in deep learning to evolutionary methods, contributing to meaningful progress in the field. Since August 2020, I've also been a Teaching Assistant at the University.

Before starting my Ph.D., I gained practical experience as a Design Electrical Engineer at PIDEC in Shiraz, Iran. There, I was involved in over ten projects in various areas. This hands-on experience not only sharpened my engineering skills but also equipped me for the interdisciplinary research challenges I face today.
