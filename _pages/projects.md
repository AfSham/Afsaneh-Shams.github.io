▪ Developed an evolutionary CNN based model achieving 99.58%, 99.32%, and 92.58% classification accuracy on
EMNIST_Digits, MNIST, and Fashion_MNIST datasets, respectively, by optimizing network efficiency.

▪ Implementing an efficient evolved neural network to determine optimal numbers of hidden layers and units to enhance
image classification accuracy on benchmark datasets.

▪ Fake image region detection & description in deepfake images, in this project the effectiveness of YOLOv3 for object
detection of PSCC-Net samples was studied & the fake objects were marked by mask or bounding box.

▪ COVID-GAN: supervised vs semi-supervised, we studied the effect of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to
classify COVID-19 from chest X-rays, enhancing detection by training with a mix of unannotated and normal images.

▪ Conducted ML analysis in WEKA for RNA structure prediction (94.01% accuracy) and EEG dataset classification.
Used methods like Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, KNN, and Neural Networks.

▪ Project Management Tool and Cinema Ticketing Website: Developed PostgreSQL, MySQL and
PhpMyAdmin for database management.

▪ A Synchronous Collaborative Programming tool to create a platform for Live coding for the sake of cooperative
learning with proper collaboration.
